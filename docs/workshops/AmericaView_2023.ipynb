        "\n",
        "**Overview:** Google Earth Engine ([GEE](https://earthengine.google.com/)) is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It enables scientists, researchers, and developers to analyze and visualize changes on the Earth’s surface. The [geemap](https://geemap.org/) Python package provides GEE users with an intuitive interface to manipulate, analyze, and visualize geospatial big data interactively in a Jupyter-based environment. The topics will be covered in this workshop include: (1) introducing geemap and the Earth Engine Python API; (2) creating interactive maps; (3) searching GEE data catalog; (4) visualizing GEE datasets; (5) analyzing GEE datasets, and (6) exporting GEE datasets. More information about the geemap Python package can be found at <https://geemap.org>.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirement:** Please [sign up](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/) for a Google Earth Engine account if you don’t have one yet. No software installation is needed. You just need a browser with Internet access for this workshop."
